So for this project, we based it off of the two latest installments in the pokemon series,
pokemon scarlet and pokemon violet. We took care of different parts of the game seperatly instead of us both working on the same part.

I took care of the first story line which is the legends road, it is the longest of the three story lines so it is the only one I did, my partner on the other hand took care of the titan path and the starfall path as they are shorter but require more attention to detail.

At the start of the game like any other pokemon game, you got to choose your starter, we unfortunatly couldn't figure out how to get the different pokemon to make a large impact on the gameplay so we developed scenarios that would play out the exact same no matter what pokemon you chose. We also decided to have the different paths feel different, for example we tried to make the path of legends feel very monotonous with you blazing past all of the gyms with minimal effort, to display a feeling of power. And we made the other paths feel very energetic as you chose not to follow the standard pokemon storyline.

We had some trouble in the beggining with planning out how we were going to do the paths, but that issue was solved quickly when we just decided to not follow the pokemon game exactly, we made our choose your own adventure experience to be more focused than the actual pokemon game to simplify the process for both us and the players.
